# Multiple data sources model time model

How could we model the time taken by a team in an organisation having to check internal and external data sources for an address?

A problem with assessing the impact of data quality in an organisation is quantitative: how does one quantify, for example, the time taken to look up or verify the time taken to consult first one data source, then another, then, perhaps, yet another?

The paper in this repository gives a probabilistic model of a single worker in an organisation with access to multiple internal and external data sources. All details are given in the paper, aloing with  code for simulating the model.
